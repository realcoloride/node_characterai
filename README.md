# Character AI Unofficial Node API

> Node.js client for the unofficial [Character AI API](https://character.ai/), an awesome website which brings characters to life with AI!

## Intro

This repository is inspired by [RichardDorian's unofficial node API](https://github.com/RichardDorian/node-character.ai/).
Though, I found it hard to use and it was not really stable and archived. So I remade it in javascript.

**This project is not affiliated with Character AI in any way! It is a community project.**
The purpose of this project is to bring and build projects powered by Character AI.

If you like this project, please check their [website](https://character.ai/).

## Features

* üëç Fully written in Javascript and CommonJS (for max compatibility and ease of use)
* ‚åö Asynchronous requests
* üó£Ô∏è Use conversations or use the API to fetch information
* üß∏ Easy to use
* üîÅ Active development
* üë§ Guest & token login support

## Installation

```bash
npm install node_characterai
```

## Usage

Basic guest authentication and message:

```javascript
const CharacterAI = require("node_characterai");
const characterAI = new CharacterAI();

(async () => {
  // Authenticating as a guest (use `.authenticateWithToken()` to use an account)
  await characterAI.authenticateAsGuest();

  // Place your character's id here
  const characterId = "8_1NyR8w1dOXmI1uWaieQcd147hecbdIK7CeEAIrdJw";

  const chat = await characterAI.createOrContinueChat(characterId);

  // Send a message
  const response = await chat.sendAndAwaitResponse("Hello discord mod!", true);

  console.log(response);
  // Use `response.text` to use it as a string
})();
```

## Using an Access Token

Some parts of the API, like managing a conversation, requires you to be logged in using an `accessToken`.

To get it, you can open your browser, go to the [Character.AI website](https://character.ai) in `localStorage`.

To do so:
1. Open the Character.AI website in your browser (https://beta.character.ai)
2. Open the developer tools (<kbd>F12</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl+J</kbd>, or <kbd>Cmd+J</kbd>)
3. Go to the `Application` tab
4. Go to the `Storage` section and click on `Local Storage`
5. Look for the `@@auth0spajs@@::dyD3gE281MqgISG7FuIXYhL2WEknqZzv::https://auth0.character.ai/::openid profile email offline_access` key
6. Open the body with the arrows and copy the access token

When using the package, you can:
* Login as guest using `authenticateAsGuest()` - *for mass usage or testing purposes*
* Login with your account or a token using `authenticateWithToken()` - *for full features and unlimited messaging*

## Finding your character's ID

You can find your character ID in the URL of a Character's chat page.

For example, if you go to the chat page of the character `Test Character` you will see the URL `https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=8_1NyR8w1dOXmI1uWaieQcd147hecbdIK7CeEAIrdJw`.

The last part of the URL is the character ID:

## Image Interactions
### WARNING: This part is currently experimental, if you encounter any problem, open an [**Issue**](https://github.com/realcoloride/node_characterai/issues).

üñºÔ∏è Character AI has the ability to generate and interpret images in a conversation. Some characters base this concept into special characters, or maybe use it for recognizing images, or to interact with a character and give it more details on something: *the possibilities are endless*.

üíÅ Most of the Character AI image features can be used like so:

```javascript
// Most of these functions will return you an URL to the image

await chat.generateImage("dolphins swimming in green water");

// If no mime type (file extension) is specified, the script will automatically detect it
await chat.uploadImage("https://www.example.com/image.jpg", "image/jpeg");

await chat.uploadImage("./photos/image.jpg");

// Other supported types are Buffers, Readable Streams, File Paths, and URLs

await chat.uploadImage(imageBuffer, "image/png");

await chat.sendAndAwaitResponse({ text: "What is in this image?", { image_rel_path: "https://www.example.com/coffee.jpg" } }, true);

// Including the image relative path is necessary to upload an image
```
*Props to @creepycats for implementing most of this stuff out*

## Troubleshooting

|**Problem**|Answer|
|-------|------|
|‚ùå **Token was invalid**|Make sure your token is actually valid and you copied your entire token (its pretty long).|
|‚ö†Ô∏è **The specified Chromium path for puppeteer could not be located**|On most systems, puppeteer will automatically locate Chromium. But on certain distributions, the path has to be specified manually. This warning occurs if `node_characterai` could not locate Chromium on linux (*/usr/bin/chromium-browser*), and will error if puppeteer cannot locate it automatically. See [this](#specifying-chromiums-path) for a fix.|
|üòÆ **Why are chromium processes opening?**|This is because as of currently, the simple fetching is broken and I use puppeteer (a chromium browser control library) to go around cloudflare's restrictions.|
|üë• **`authenticateAsGuest()` doesn't work**|See issue [#14](https://github.com/realcoloride/node_characterai/issues/14).|
|ü¶í **Hit the max amount of messages?**|Sadly, guest accounts only have a limited amount of messages before they get limited and forced to login. See below for more info üëá|
|ü™ê **How to use an account to mass use the library?**|You can use **conversations**, a feature introduced in `1.0.0`, to assign to users and channels. **To reproduce a conversation, use OOC (out of character) to make the AI think you're with multiple people.** __See an example here:__ ![chrome_RDbmXXtFNl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108619637/224778145-284dd89e-7960-499c-b0f0-0deca419c578.png)![chrome_BgF8crPvqC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108619637/224778153-c2a42a26-c5f7-4148-9644-34353482833e.png) (Disclaimer: on some characters, their personality will make them ignore any OOC request).|
|üì£ **Is this official?**|No, this project is made by a fan of the website and is unofficial. *To support the developers, please check out [their website](https://beta.character.ai)*.|
|üò≤ **Did something awesome with `node_characterai`?**|Please let me know!|

## In-depth troubleshooting
#### **ü§ö Before you scroll, please know that:**
* In the `Client` class, you can access the `Requester` class and define puppeteer or other variables related to how CharacterAI will work using `characterAI.requester.(property)`. *Also, anything here is subject to change, so make sure to update the package frequently.*

### üí≥ About CharacterAI+
#### **"I am a member of cai+, how do I use it?"**

Change the property `.usePlus` from the requester and if needed, change `.forceWaitingRoom`.

For example:
```javascript
// Default is `false`
characterAI.requester.usePlus = true;
```

### üß≠ About Puppeteer
Around a few months ago, the package only required the `node-fetch` module to run. The package was made using simple API requests.

*However, over time, Cloudflare started fighting against scraping and bots, which also made it almost impossible for anyone to use this package.*

**This is where in versions 1.1 and higher, puppeteer is used (which uses a chromium browser) to make requests with the API.**

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to change Puppeteer settings
 **üëâ IMPORTANT: do the changes *before* you initialize your client!**

In the CharacterAI class, you can access the requester and define the `.puppeteerPath` variable or other arguments, and the properties include *(and are subject to change in future versions)*:
```javascript
// Chromium executable path (in some linux distributions, /usr/bin/chromium-browser)
puppeteerPath;
// Default arguments for when the browser launches
puppeteerLaunchArgs;
// Boolean representing the default timeout (default is 30000ms)
puppeteerNoDefaultTimeout;
// Number representing the default protocol timeout
puppeteerProtocolTimeout;
```

##### Specifying Chromium's path
üêß For linux users, if your puppeteer doesn't automatically detect the path to Chromium, you will need to specify it manually.

To do this, you just need to set `puppeteerPath` to your Chromium path:
```javascript
characterAI.puppeteerPath = "/path/to/chromium-browser";
```

On Linux, you can use the `which` command to find where Chromium is installed:
```bash
$ which chromium-browser # or whatever command you use to launch chrome
```

üí° I recommend that you __frequently__ update this package for bug fixes and new additions.
